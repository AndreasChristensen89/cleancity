Cleaner Copenhagen

Table of contents:

Purpose of website:
Introduce people to a fictional group that picks up litter in the parks of Copenhagen.
This group consists of volunteers and relies on word of mouth and visitors to this website.
The website should provide a quick overview of what the group is, when they operate, how to get in contact with them, and how to join.

User Experience Considerations:
Target group is people living in or close to Copenhagen. Anyone able to show up in person can join, so location is the only criteria.

The User
- What are the goals for a first time visitor
- What are the goals for a returning visitor

Design choices
- Overview
    The aim is to provide easy-to-navigate pages that make it easy and clear to navigate around, with many links to the contact/join page.
    Information should not be detailed but fast to read and understand, and straight to the point.

- Color Scheme 
Colors are chosen to represent a "natural" scenery that hint of being in a park/forest, 
which hopefully leads users to envision being outside in nature.
    - Background color: #EAE7DC
    - Logo, titles, navbar elements, top of call-to-action divs, top of form: #61892F
    - Cover text hero-image, Call-to-action divs headings: standard white
    - Call-to-action icons: standard green
    - Footer background color: rgb(177, 142, 96)
    - Footer icons and text: #EEE2DC

- Choice of text
For text choice I leaned towards the Love Running project, which used Lato and Oswald. Google Fonts provides fonts that are similar,
so I went with Lato with a different text-partner.
