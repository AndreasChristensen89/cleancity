# Cleaner Copenhagen

The idea behind this project was to create a simple website for a group that picks up litter in the parks of Copenhagen.
This group consists of volunteers and for recruitment relies on word of mouth and visitors to this website.
The target group is people living in or close to Copenhagen. Anyone able to show up in person can join, so location is the only criteria along
with fitness to be able to walk around for a period. This is a cleaner group, but it's also a social group, so adults, teenagers, and children 
are all welcome.

The name Cleaner Copenhagen is meant as a play on words, as in they are, and are searching for, cleaners in Copenhagen, and they are also 
striving for a cleaner Copenhagen.

Features

## Existing features:
* Navigation bar
    * The navigation bar is on all four pages. It has links to the Home page, the About page, the What We Do page, and the Contact page.
    Visually, it is identical on each page but with a bottom border under the current page. It always sticks to the top when scrolling.
    * This section allows the user to always be able to navigate to all parts of the website without going back to the home page, or
    scrolling to the top.

* Landing page image / hero image
    * The landing page has a large image with a text bar horizontally over the middle which contains an inspiring message to join the group.
    The text bar has a different message on each page that corresponds to the purpose/content.
    * The image is a bright city park with a curving road which communicates to the user what the group is aiming for: a beautiful spotless 
    clean park.

* Call to action
    * The following section has three boxes each with links to the different pages on the site. Each box has a short description of why the 
    user should click the link.
    * Each box has large green icons that gives a visual hint of what the content of the link is. Along with the description this makes it 
    easier for the user to quickly understand what it is.

* Meetup times
    * This section lets the user know that the group is active and meeting up four times every week. Where and when is short and precise. 
    The dates and places will update according to group activities.
    * Each box has a background image of people picking up litter in green and bright scenery, which serves to give a positive outdoor feeling.
    Each box also links to the contact page where it's possible contact the group, to this there are added hover-animations to hint to the user
    that the boxes are clickable.

* Footer
    - The footer includes four links to FaceBook, YouTube, Instagram, and Twitter that each opens in a new tab. To the right is a copyright 
    statement. The social media links are represented with icons, and have animations when hovering over them. The footer is at the bottom 
    of every page.
    - The footer is valuable to the user as they can easily navigate through the social media accounts of the group.

* About us
    * It has four areas; two text based, one picture, and one button. The text is unspecific but invites the user to contact them for more 
    details. The picture shows two children holding a bag a litter together, which is meant to symbolise unity and also complement the title 
    "doing good together". The button underneath is visually striking due to the size, the border, and the message icon. It is meant to quickly 
    signal it's purpose.
    * This section is to casually inform the user of who is behind the group. It is valuable to the user to know that the group is for everyone,
    and that it also sets up additional family-oriented events.
    
* What we do - top
    * This section has a similar setup as the "about us" page, but with no contact button. In the middle there is a picture showing a girl
    holding two plastic bags with litter in order to show that litter can be found in the parks. 
    * It is valuable to the user to understand why the group operates, due to the fact that parks in Copenhagen are generally quite clean.

* What we do - bottom
    * In three headings with text this section talks about what the activities are about. It's fun, anyone can join, and there are only a few
    things to bring.
    * It is valuable to the user to understand that the activities are not dangerous and can be done by everyone, and also the specifics of
    what to bring.

* Contact
    * This is the contact form and it follows the style of the home page boxes. Along with the first name, last name, and email, the user also
    picks a subject to specify for the receiver: Become a member, Questions, and Other. The user can write a message, clear form, and submit.
    * It is important to the user to be able to contact the group.

## Features left to implement
    - Clicking on an event could fill in part of a form of which event the user wishes to register for.
    - Form should accomodate users wishes to register for specific events.



## Testing
* Chrome Developer Tools for testing all media queries down to 280px to fit the smallest devide available on their list. Also, manipulating 
with CSS to see direct outcomes.
* (upcoming) Test on Firefox, Microsoft Edge

* Media query tested on my own phone, Samsung Galaxy S9.
* Media query tested on my own tablet, Ipad pro 2018.
* General testing with my own laptop, Asus 13".

"In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. 
Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your project’s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project 
providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.
You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed 
them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Icons and script were taken from https://fontawesome.com/ 


* Coding help
    * For help with varius issues with animations, sticky navigation bar, background manipulation etc. I often resorted to 
    https://stackoverflow.com/
    * Code Institute Slack Community for additional help with details (aria-label, general requirements, deployment)

* Design
    * For design of the different pages I took inspiration from other students of Code Institute that request reviews of their projects. Also,
    I looked at various websites of professionals, e.g. https://www.wimhofmethod.com/
    * For color schemes I used a blog on Visme that had 50 examples of good color combinations: https://visme.co/blog/website-color-schemes/

## User Experience Considerations:

Strategy
Scope
Structure
Skeleton
Surface

The User
- What are the goals for a first time visitor
- What are the goals for a returning visitor

Design choices
- Overview
    The aim is to provide easy-to-navigate pages that make it easy and clear to navigate around, with many links to the contact/join page.
    Information should not be detailed but fast to read and understand, and straight to the point.

- Color Scheme 
Colors are chosen to represent a "natural" scenery that hint of being in a park/forest, 
which hopefully leads users to envision being outside in nature.
    - Background color: #EAE7DC
    - Logo, titles, navbar elements, top of call-to-action divs, top of form: #61892F
    - Font of call-to-action divs: rgb(211, 203, 161)
    - Cover text hero-image, Call-to-action divs headings: standard white
    - Call-to-action icons: standard green
    - Footer background color: rgb(177, 142, 96)
    - Footer icons and text: #EEE2DC

- Choice of text
For text choice I leaned towards the Love Running project, which used Lato and Oswald. After testing with other fonts (Roboto, Open Sans, Raleway)
I found Lato to work quite well with both text and headings.

Picture:
Sunny, bright and green pictures were targeted to with the aim of thinking of nice weather, as the activity would be outside.

Languages used
- HTML
- CSS
- (upcoming) Markdown

Accesibility (upcoming)
All non-text elements is marked with aria-label, and there is a contrast between background and foreground colors.
